## Installation

Note that JavaScript libraries are not packaged in Nix. Only JavaScript applications are.

Building the package:

```sh
nix-build -E '(import ./pkgs.nix).callPackage ./default.nix {}'
```

Building the releases:

```sh
nix-build ./release.nix --attr application
nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker
```

Install into Nix user profile:

```sh
nix-env -f ./release.nix --install --attr application
```

Install into Docker:

```sh
docker load --input "$(nix-build ./release.nix --attr docker)"
```

## Development

Run `nix-shell`, and once you're inside, you can use:

```sh
# install (or reinstall packages from package.json)
npm install
# build the dist
npm run build
# run the repl (this allows you to import from ./src)
npm run ts-node
# run the tests
npm run test
# lint the source code
npm run lint
# automatically fix the source
npm run lintfix
```

### Calling Executables

When calling executables in development, use this style:

```
npm run typescript-demo-lib -- p1 p2 p3
```

The `--` is necessary to make `npm` understand that the parameters are for your own executable, and not parameters to `npm`.

### Using the REPL

```
$ npm run ts-node
> import fs from 'fs';
> fs
> import { Library } from '@';
> Library
> import Library as Library2 from './src/lib/Library';
```

You can also create test files in `./src`, and run them with `npm run ts-node ./src/test.ts`.

This allows you to test individual pieces of typescript code, and it makes it easier when doing large scale architecting of TypeScript code.

### Path Aliases

Due to https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/10866, you cannot use path aliases without a bundler like Webpack to further transform the generated JavaScript code in order to resolve the path aliases. Because this is a simple library demonstration, there's no need to use a bundler. In fact, for such libraries, it is far more efficient to not bundle the code.

However, we have left the path alias configuration in `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js` and in the tests we are making use of the `@` alias.

#### VSCode Path Aliases

VSCode cannot follow path aliases in our tests due to
https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/94474.

To resolve this, add `./tests/**/*` into the `tsconfig` `include` section:

```json
  "include": [
    "./src/**/*",
    "./tests/**/*'
  ]
```

This will however make `tsc` build the `tests` into the `dist` output.

**Therefore this fix should only be done in your own workspace, do not commit or push this change up.**

### Native Module Toolchain

There are some nuances when packaging with native modules.
Included native modules are level witch include leveldown and utp-native.

If a module is not set to public then pkg defaults to including it as bytecode.
To avoid this breaking with the `--no-bytecode` flag we need to add `--public-packages "*"`

#### leveldown

To get leveldown to work with pkg we need to include the prebuilds with the executable.
after building with pkg you need to copy from `node_modules/leveldown/prebuilds` -> `path_to_executable/prebuilds`
You only need to include the prebuilds for the arch you are targeting. e.g. for linux-x64 you need `prebuild/linux-x64`.

The folder structure for the executable should look like this.
- linux_executable_elf
- prebuilds
  - linux-x64
    - (node files)

#### utp-native

Including utp-native is simpler, you just need to add it as an asset for pkg.
Add the following lines to the package.json.
```json
"pkg": {
    "assets": "node_modules/utp-native/**/*"
  }
```

#### threads.js

To make sure that the worker threads work properly you need to include the compiled worker scripts as an asset.
This can be fixed by adding the following to `package.json`

```json
"pkg": {
    "assets": "dist/bin/worker.js"
  }
```

If you need to include multiple assets then add them as an array.

```json
"pkg": {
    "assets": [
      "node_modules/utp-native/**/*",
      "dist/bin/worker.js"
    ]
  }
```

#### Integration into Nix

Nix build uses node2nix to create the dependencies of the node modules. this does a fairly good job of detecting dependencies but with native modules it may fail to detect CLI tools like `node-gyp-build`.

To ensure the proper dependencies exist while building we need to bring in these utilities during the build:

```
buildInputs = attrs.buildInputs ++ [ nodePackages.node-gyp-build ];
```

This has to be done to both `node2nixProd` and `node2nixDev`.
